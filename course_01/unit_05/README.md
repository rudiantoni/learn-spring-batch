## Practice

<details open><summary>Details</summary>

- [arquivo-largura-fixa](practice/arquivo-largura-fixa)
    - Reading files with fixed width content (fixed number of columns).
- [arquivo-largura-fixa-v2](practice/arquivo-largura-fixa-v2)
    - Reading files with fixed width content (fixed number of columns).
- [arquivo-delimitado](practice/arquivo-delimitado)
    - Reading files with values delimited by chars.
- [arquivo-multiplos-formatos](practice/arquivo-multiplos-formatos)
    - Reading files whose values are delimited by chars and that can be associated with more than one domain class (entity).
    - Stabilishing relations with domain classes register.
    - Reading multi data source files with path provided via job parameters.
    - Now using multi data source file reading with path provided by profile property.
    - Using delegate for mapping purposes and a better flow control.
- [xml-reader](practice/xml-reader)
    - Reading files using ItemReader reader and JAXB-2 Marshaller as a marshaller (write)/unmarshaller (read) for Java Objects and XML.
        - Marshal: means transform a Java Object into a XML document.
        - Unmarshal: means transform a XML document into a Java Object.
- [json-reader](practice/json-reader)
    - Reading files using JsonItemReader reader and using Jackson as a serializer between Java Objects and JSON.
- [jdbc-cursor-reader](practice/jdbc-cursor-reader)
    - Reading data with Cursor with reader JdbcCursorReader.
    - Using a secondary database connection, domain class auto mapped by attributes and result set equality.
    - In this project some database routines such as building migration and rollback scripts generation were automated via bash script.
    - Updated reader row mapping to a custom making it possible to use any database column name and any domain class attribute name.
    - Some code is commented, but it's showed the different ways to use the row mapper, and the bean row mapper.
- [jdbc-paging-reader](practice/jdbc-paging-reader)
    - Reading data with Pagination with reader JdbcPagingItemReader.
    - Using a secondary database connection, domain class auto mapped by attributes and result set equality.
    - Using generic query provider builder with SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean to general usage.
    - Using PostgreSQL specific query provider builder with PostgresPagingQueryProvider to usage only with PostgreSQL databases for demonstration purposes. Some of the code was left commented to not affect the ordinary flow.
    - Using @Qualifier injected in constructor to define DataSource at the reader configuration.
    - Added property in order to be able to see logging about the paging and current data processing pagination in .properties file.
    - Updated contents and already present migration and rollback filenames.
    - Updated migration and rollback script to use standard flyway (not included in project) location.
    - Updated reader row mapping to a custom making it possible to use any database column name and any domain class attribute name.
    - Some code is commented, but it's showed the different ways to use the row mapper, and the bean row mapper.
- [skip-exception](practice/skip-exception)
    - Same as [jdbc-paging-reader](practice/jdbc-paging-reader).
    - There are a forced error (exception thrown) to emulate the skip failure policy.

    - No result set remapping to the domain class.

## Exercise

<details open><summary>Details</summary>

- [T6-DemonstrativoOrcamentario-Exercicio](exercise/T6-DemonstrativoOrcamentario-Exercicio)
    - Exercise base files (there's no base project in this exercise.)
    - Objective: 1. Print data in a certain format using multiple files as data source.
        - Read data from multiple files.
        - Delegating a reader to properly read and deliver the data to the writer in the correct form.
        - Write the data to the screen in the specified way.
        - Structure: of domain, job, step, reader, delegated reader and writer.
            - Domain: BudgetItem and BudgetCategory
            - Job: No parameter.
            - Step: MultiResourceItemReader and ItemWriter.
            - Reader: MultiResourceItemReader (delegating to BudgetItemDelegatedReader that implements ItemStreamReader and ResourceAwareItemReaderItemStream, and needs a FlatFileItemReader as delegated reader), FlatFileItemReader, GenericApplicationContext,  LineMapper, LineTokenizer and FieldSetMapper.
            - Writer: ItemWriter.
    - Objective: 2. Print data in a certain format using database as data source.
        - Read data from multiple files.
        - Delegating a reader to properly read and deliver the data to the writer in the correct form.
        - Write the data to the screen in the specified way.
            - Config: DataSource
            - Domain: BudgetItem and BudgetCategory
            - Job: No parameter.
            - Step: JdbcPagingItemReader (delegating to BudgetItemJdbcDelegatedReader that implements ItemStreamReader, and needs a JdbcPagingItemReader) and ItemWriter.
            - Reader: JdbcPagingItemReader, DataSource, PostgresPagingQueryProvider and RowMapper.
            - Writer: ItemWriter.
    - [budget-statement-exercise](exercise/T6-budget-statement-Resposta/budget-statement-exercise)
        - Exercise answer.
        - Project reading data from multiple files and returning custom objects to the writer with the usage of delegate.
        - Updated project, now it's reading data from database with JdbcPagingItemReader, using delegate directly at the Step config.
    - [T6-DemonstrativoOrcamentario-Gabarito](exercise/T6-DemonstrativoOrcamentario-Gabarito)
        - Exercise instructor answer.
