# Unit 5 - Spring Batch Readers
[Home (online)](https://github.com/rudiantoni/learn-spring-batch)

## Practice
- [arquivo-largura-fixa](practice/arquivo-largura-fixa)
    - Reading files with fixed width content (fixed number of columns).
- [arquivo-largura-fixa-v2](practice/arquivo-largura-fixa-v2)
    - Reading files with fixed width content (fixed number of columns).
- [arquivo-delimitado](practice/arquivo-delimitado)
    - Reading files with values delimited by chars.
- [arquivo-multiplos-formatos](practice/arquivo-multiplos-formatos)
    - Reading files whose values are delimited by chars and that can be associated with more than one domain class (entity).
    - Stabilishing relations with domain classes register.
    - Reading multi data source files with path provided via job parameters.
    - Now using multi data source file reading with path provided by profile property.
    - Using delegate for mapping purposes and a better flow control.
- [xml-reader](practice/xml-reader)
    - Reading files using ItemReader reader and JAXB-2 Marshaller as a marshaller (write)/unmarshaller (read) for Java Objects and XML.
        - Marshal: means transform a Java Object into a XML document.
        - Unmarshal: means transform a XML document into a Java Object.
- [json-reader](practice/json-reader)
    - Reading files using JsonItemReader reader and using Jackson as a serializer between Java Objects and JSON.
- [jdbc-cursor-reader](practice/jdbc-cursor-reader)
    - Reading data with Cursor with reader JdbcCursorReader.
    - Using a secondary database connection, domain class auto mapped by attributes and result set equality.
    - In this project some database routines such as building migration and rollback scripts generation were automated via bash script.
    - Updated reader row mapping to a custom making it possible to use any database column name and any domain class attribute name.
    - Some code is commented, but it's showed the different ways to use the row mapper, and the bean row mapper.
- [jdbc-paging-reader](practice/jdbc-paging-reader)
    - Reading data with Pagination with reader JdbcPagingItemReader.
    - Using a secondary database connection, domain class auto mapped by attributes and result set equality.
    - Using generic query provider builder with SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean to general usage.
    - Using PostgreSQL specific query provider builder with PostgresPagingQueryProvider to usage only with PostgreSQL databases for demonstration purposes. Some of the code was left commented to not affect the ordinary flow.
    - Using @Qualifier injected in constructor to define DataSource at the reader configuration.
    - Added property in order to be able to see logging about the paging and current data processing pagination in .properties file.
    - Updated contents and already present migration and rollback filenames.
    - Updated migration and rollback script to use standard flyway (not included in project) location.
    - Updated reader row mapping to a custom making it possible to use any database column name and any domain class attribute name.
    - Some code is commented, but it's showed the different ways to use the row mapper, and the bean row mapper.
- [skip-exception](practice/skip-exception)
    - Same as [jdbc-paging-reader](practice/jdbc-paging-reader).
    - There are a forced error (exception thrown) to emulate the skip failure policy.
